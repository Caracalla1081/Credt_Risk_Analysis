# Credt_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
Evaluating who is and is not a good cancidate to loan money to has historically been one of the toughest aspects of operating a lending company. As an employee at the credit lending company Fast Lending they are of the belief that one way to imporve their identification of credit worthy applicants is by utilizing machine learning.

I am to assist the lead data scientist, Jill, in creating several machine learning models that will predict an applicant's credit risk, and then evaluate each algorithim's performance to determine which one; if any, can be used by the company moving forward.

## Results
### RandomOverSampler Algorithm

- Balanced Accuracy Score: The balanced accuracry score of .67 can be considered "good" at prediciting who is and who is not at a worthy candidate for credit lending.
- Precision Score: The precision score of .01 for identifying "high-risk" and score of 1 for identifying "low-risk" indicates that there are a large amount of false positives for "high-risk", meaning the classification of "low-risk" us unreliable.
- Accuracy Score:
